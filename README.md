**Description:**

Sailing Trip Planner is a Windows Form Application, written in C#. 

This particular application is tailored to my personal sailboat, a 1967 Cal 25, moored at Squalicum Harbor, where majority of my trips occur in and around the San Juan Islands area.

This application is not meant to be used as a replacement to proper Navigation resources, and is primarily useful as an aid,  and a planning tool when navigation resources are not available.

**Presentation**

A PowerPoint presentation is available for download under the STP directory, SailingNavigation.pptx.

**Images**

Images used throughout the Application are available under the STP directory in the subfolders, Background, NavCharts, and ExtraTools.
